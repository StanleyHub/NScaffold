* Function name should like `Get-Something`
* All shared files shoud contain suffix `.ns.ps1`
* All private files shoud not contain any suffix
* Pure script file name should like `doSomething[.ns].ps1`
* File with single function should be named **as same as that function**
* File with mutiple functions should be named like `_some_functions[.ns].ps1`

"Root" Paths
========

* `$root` is the starting script root path
* `$libsRoot` is the lib root path
* `$toolsRoot` is the tool root path
* All path should have specific meanings, should remain the same within different executing context.
